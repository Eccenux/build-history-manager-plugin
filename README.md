# Build History Manager Plugin

[Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) plugin that allows to define which builds should be removed from the history and which preserved.

## Philosophy
The motivation of creating this plugin is to deliver powerful plugin that allows to define rules:
  - which build should be processed (eg by status, branch)
  - how the build should be processed (eg. delete)
